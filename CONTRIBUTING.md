# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to this project! A few recommendations to keep the repository clean and useful:

- Use branches for features and fixes. Name them like `feature/<short-description>` or `fix/<short-description>`.
- Open a Pull Request for any change you want to merge into `main`.
- Write clear commit messages. Use the present tense and a short subject line (50 chars max) and a longer body if needed.
- Keep documentation updated in `ProjectSummary.md` and `README.md`.
- If adding code, include small tests where feasible and run them locally before opening a PR.

Repository maintainer: initial owner (you) — consider adding CODEOWNERS and issue templates later.
